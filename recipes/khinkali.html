        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Khinkali has deep roots in Georgian culinary history, believed to have originated in the mountainous regions of Pshavi, Mtiuleti, and Khevsureti in the north of Georgia. Traditionally, it was a practical and hearty food for shepherds and travelers. It was easy to carry, filling, and made from simple, locally available ingredients like flour, meat, and spices. Over time, khinkali spread across Georgia and evolved from a rural staple into a national symbol of hospitality and comfort.</p>
