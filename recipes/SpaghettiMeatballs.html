        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Pasta has existed in Italy since at least the 12th century, and spaghetti (from the word spago, meaning "thin string") became a staple by the 19th century. Spaghetti was usually served with simple tomato sauces, especially in the south of Italy where tomatoes were abundant. Between the late 1800s and early 1900s, millions of Italian immigrants, primarily from Southern Italy, moved to the United States. In America, they found cheaper meat, canned tomatoes, and dried pasta, all readily available. These ingredients came together to form spaghetti and meatballs. This dish that didn't exist in Italy but quickly became a staple of Italian-American cooking.</p>
